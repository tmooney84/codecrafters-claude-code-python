# Pythonic Implementation of Basic Claude Code Clone

Claude Code is an AI coding assistant that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to
understand code and perform actions through tool calls. In this challenge,
you'll build your own Claude Code from scratch by implementing an LLM-powered
coding assistant.

Along the way you'll learn about HTTP RESTful APIs, OpenAI-compatible tool
calling, agent loop, and how to integrate multiple tools into an AI assistant.

## Installation and Usage

1. Download from GitHub

   Using SSH:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:tmooney84/codecrafters-claude-code-python.git
   ```

   ```
   Using HTTPS: https://github.com/tmooney84/codecrafters-claude-code-python.git
   ```

2. Navigate to Local Repo Directory
   ``` 
   cd codecrafters-claude-code-python
   ```

3. Ensure you have `uv` installed locally.

4. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `app/main.py`.

5. Run `codecrafters submit` to submit your solution to CodeCrafters. Test
   output will be streamed to your terminal.
